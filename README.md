### Graph_summarizer   
 &nbsp;

Summarize long texts by combining graph-algorithmic approaches with distributive language vector models.   

Work in progress.   

Some code was taken from my [another](https://github.com/mitya8128/nlp_graph) repository.   

I did not decide yet wthere it's good idea to include those code to the old one.
